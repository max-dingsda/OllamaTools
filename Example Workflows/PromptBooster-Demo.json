The thick stone walls stand tall and proud against the backdrop of the somber landscape, their textured surfaces weather-beaten and aged with history. The heavy rain cascades down in sheets, illuminating the castle's turrets and spires with flickering flashes of light that dance eerily in the darkness. The castle's wooden doors and windows creak under the weight of the torrential rain, beckoning us into their sanctuary while the ominous sound of thunder echoes through the valley below. It is a scene both ominous and majestic, reminding us of the power and resilience of those who once called this castle home."]},{"id":2,"type":"Text Box","pos":[403.2142639160156,182.30018615722656],"size":[400,200],"flags":{},"order":0,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"Text","name":"Text","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"Text"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"Text","name":"Text","type":"STRING","links":[1]}],"properties":{"aux_id":"HavocsCall/comfyui_HavocsCall_Custom_Nodes","ver":"5eee3911a15745d2099b6a343afd267cfac2229b","Node name for S&R":"Text Box"},"widgets_values":["a medieval castle in the mountains on a rainy day"]}],"links":[[1,2,0,1,0,"STRING"],[2,1,0,3,0,"STRING"]],"groups":[],"config":{},"extra":{"ds":{"scale":1.1419980000000258,"offset":[-296.722413810141,25.397320228419844]}},"version":0.4}
